# floorp-gx-fixed
 Fixed Floorp GX and Nord theme. Original from Godiesc: https://github.com/Godiesc/floorp-gx

 Steps to configure the theme:

   Download this repository and unzip the file
   Copy the "chrome" folder and the "user.js" file into your Firefox or Floorp profile directory.
   Install and use a compatible theme (Nord theme: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nord-firefox/).
   Restart the browser.

   To find out the location of your profile directory go to about:support and find "Profile Folder". Then click "Open Folder"
 
 Of course you can change your browser color by click "components/ogx_root-personal.css" on "userContent.css" file
